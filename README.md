# StrokePlugins

**Plugin collection for [Stroke](https://github.com/poerin/Stroke) mouse gesture engine.**

This repository hosts a set of plugins that extend Stroke’s capabilities. Each plugin is distributed as a self-contained .NET class library (DLL) and is designed to be dropped into Stroke’s working directory for instant gesture-driven access.

## Installation & Usage

1. Download the latest release of the desired plugin from this repository, or compile the source code yourself.
2. Place the resulting `.dll` file (e.g., `Stroke.TranslateMate.dll`) into the same folder as `Stroke.exe`.
3. Restart Stroke.
4. Configure a gesture in the Stroke configurator to call the plugin’s public API.

Each plugin exposes its functionality through a static class in the `Stroke` namespace. You call its methods directly in your Stroke action scripts. Refer to the individual plugin READMEs for API credentials and example scripts.

## Developing Your Own Plugin

To create a new plugin:
1. Create a new Class Library project targeting **.NET Framework 4.8**.
2. Use the `Stroke` namespace for your public static class.
3. Implement your logic and expose `static` methods that Stroke scripts can call.
4. Name your DLL using the convention `Stroke.<PluginName>.dll`.

If your plugin needs to reference types from the Stroke engine, add the Stroke project as a reference. The recommended way is to include Stroke source code as a project reference in your solution, ensuring your plugin builds against the latest Stroke source.
